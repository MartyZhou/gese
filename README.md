# gese

There are two files.
One is a dataset,containing information of user-id, depression, gene and stressful life events.
Another one is a research paper that you could refer to.

The question is how stressful life events influence the relationship between gene and depression. You could use any methods and lauguages to solve the problem. Original codes and a report about the question are required. You could upload them here.

Good luck.
